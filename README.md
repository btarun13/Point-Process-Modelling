# Point-Process-Modelling

We study distribution of data across a spatial space in Spatial Statistics. There are certain processes in nature that don't have a specific value at a particular point. Rather the Point itself is the part of information. 
Point process is a process where points occur randomly over a specified space. Since the process is random, we try to study whether there are patterns present inside the space and whether we can derive some information out of it.
Here is my attempt to show test we can use to test and see if the given point process is Clustered or regular. Also, If there is any spatial correaltion over distances.
